        I worked with Aire to develop a brand that firmly positions them as a
        premium lifestyle brand. The name Aire was inspired by the companies
        conception in Aire Street Workshops, in addition to aligning well with
        how the product makes you feel. The wordmark has been designed to convey
        the feeling of ease and simplicity whilst encapsulating a premium feel.
        Aire believes in the power of CBD to help people manage the day to day a
        little better â€” so I developed a strap-line which embodied that message.
        A better way to deal with every day.
